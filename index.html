					Slipgate Ironworks is a game development studio <br>
					located in Aalborg, Denmark. <br><br>

					We’re comprised of industry veterans and talent, <br>
					having worked on both indie and AAA titles for <br>
					the past 2 decades.<br><br>

					Our first title was the critically acclaimed <br>
					„Rise of the Triad”, under the name; Interceptor <br> 
					Entertainment. Rise of the Triad was released in <br>
					2013, and was considered by many as the birth <br>
					of the modern retro shooter. <br> <br>

					Since then, we’ve been involved in a range of <br>
					games, including Rad Rodgers, Ion Fury, <br>
					Ancestors Legacy, and most recently, WRATH: <br>
					 Aeon of Ruin, which is built using the original <br>
					„QUAKE” engine, known from many '90s classics. <br> <br>

					Slipgate Ironworks is built on a strong <br> 
					foundation of veteran developers who all share <br>
					the same vision; <br> <br>

					„We only work on games we’d play ourselves” <br> <br>

					We are our own worst critics and we share a deep <br>
					understading of what makes certain games „Tick”. <br> <br>

					We all come from a background of hard-core first <br>
					person shooters and we all share a deep knowledge <br>
					of how games of the past have influenced generations. <br> <br>
					Some might even call us old-school:<br>
					A badge we wear proudly.
